Issue and pull request labeling bot for [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs][NixOS/nixpkgs]].

** Rationale

Labels are more useful than search queries for filtering through
issues. However, labeling is menial, and typically not thorough enough.

** Changing labeling rules

Change [[file:src/main/resources/ruleset.edn][ruleset.edn]] right from GitHub interface and open a pull request.

** Deployment

You will need AWS account and Maven. Build via ~mvn deploy~, add a new AWS
Lambda function targeting Java 8 runtime, upload jar-with-dependencies and save
the function. After that, create a new empty AWS API Gateway, add a POST
resource, attach previously created AWS Lambda to it, create a new stage and
deploy it.

You should get URL that is usable as a GitHub webhook. Choose ~application/json~
content type, and only send Issues and Pull request events to the bot.
